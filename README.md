# Plugins for Harmony

All Harmony's plugins are open-sourced.

Feel free to use them as example to create your own plugins

Documentation for creating plugins is available [here](https://getharmony.xyz/docs).

## Install a plugin

**Auto-install**: Open Harmony's settings, and simply copy-paste the raw .js file url in Harmony then hit *install*. 

**Manual install**: Simply put the .js in:
- `%APPDATA%/Harmony/Plugins/` on Windows
- `~/.config/Harmony/Plugins/` on Linux
- `~/Library/Application Support/Harmony/Plugins/` on macOS
